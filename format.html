<h1>Paper Formatting Requirements</h1>
<p>
Submissions to ACM CCS 2017 must follow the
<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">new
ACM conference template</a>, which has been updated for 2017.  Submissions
should not use older ACM formats or non-standard formatting.
</p>
<p>
The page limit for CCS submissions is at most 12 pages body content
using this format, with any number of additional pages for the
bibliography, well-marked appendices, and any desired supplementary
material.  When relevant, submitters may include reviews from past
submissions and responses to them in the supplementary material.
Reviewers are not required to consider the appendices or supplementary
material, however, so submissions need to be intelligible and
convincing without them.  Submissions not meeting these guidelines, or
playing games to work around page limits, will be rejected by the PC
chairs without review.  In particular, papers should not use squeezing
tricks to adjust the (already very dense) ACM paper format, and moving
discussion of key related work or important definitions to appendices
may be grounds for rejection.
</p>
<p>
Because the provided format does not yet work well for most people and
the ACM has not been responsive in fixing it, we have created a new
and simpler version of this template to use for ACM CCS 2017
submissions: <a href="https://github.com/acmccs/format"><em>https://github.com/acmccs/format</em></a>. Your
submission should start from the provided
template: <a href="https://github.com/acmccs/format/blob/master/ccs-template.tex">ccs-template.tex</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you are using something other than LaTeX to produce your paper, see the 
<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM
Master Article Template</a> site for links to versions of the template
for Word. If you are using something else, you will need to create a
fomat that closely resembles the specified ACM format.
